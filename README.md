homebrew-gnuradio
=================

Delicious --HEAD only tap of the latest development version of gnuradio! Yay! Builds clean on Mavericks with clang/llvm.  No patching or messing around, this recipe just works. 

To use, simply 
```sh
brew tap jonbrenner/gnuradio
brew install --HEAD gnuradio --with-qt --with-docs
```

Omit `--with-qt` and `--with-docs` at your descretion.  This is a very dependency heavy recipe, so if you're starting from scratch, make sure have access to food because you'll probably need a snack before it's done.  I like nutella on toast, personally.

Awwwww yisssss.
